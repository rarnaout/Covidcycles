For most of the COVID-19 pandemic, the daily focus has been on the number of cases. 

This still seems to be true as the omicron wave hits.

But omicron on the whole has been much milder. For those who have been recently doubly or triple vaccinated and/or recently infected and are free from underlying comorbidities (of which the list is long), the risk of death is very small. The primary risk of this phase of the pandemic is of those not in the above groups getting sick all at once, overwhelming available beds, while the healthcare workforce is itself depleted as workers quarantine or are at home suffering (usually mild) symptoms.

An interesting way to visualize differences in the various peaks is to plot deaths as a function of cases.

The function in <a href=:"https://github.com/rarnaout/Covidcycles/blob/main/covid_deaths_vs_cases.ipynb">the python notebook</a> `plot_deaths_vs_cases`, does this.

Please use as you see fit, as long as it's with attribution.
